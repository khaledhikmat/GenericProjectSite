<p>
This site is a sample project site written in <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. It is best fit for a requirements phase where user stories are
written, designed, estimated and commented on. Most of the user story information come from a <a href="www.plurasight.com">Pluralsight</a> course titled 
<a href="http://pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/agile-team-practice-fundamentals">Agile Team Practices with Scrum</a> written by David 
Starr.

I am also planning to write a blog about how things work and the obstacles that I ran into and how I solved them. I will update this once done./ul>
